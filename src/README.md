# About

This is a simple Typescript implementation of the classic Machi Koro game.

# Technical

It has been designed to be easily extended to include cards and gameplay from the two expansions, and runs each game as a self-contained instance. One can add additional UI classes to support alternative views -- it currently includes a command line UI as reference -- and add additional Application classes to support alternative platforms or networked play.
